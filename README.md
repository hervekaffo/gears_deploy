# Gears (React Native)

This repository contains the Gears React Native (Expo) application.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

2. Start Expo

```bash
npx expo start
```

3. Open the app on a device or simulator using the Expo devtools.

Notes
- This repo uses Expo. There are platform-specific directories (`ios/`, `android/`) which are ignored by default in `.gitignore` — remove those lines if you plan to check in native projects.
- Add any secrets to an `.env` file (ignored by `.gitignore`).

Contact
- If you need me to initialize the Git repo and push to GitHub, tell me the desired repository name and whether you want it public or private. If you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and it's authenticated locally, I can create the remote and push for you.
